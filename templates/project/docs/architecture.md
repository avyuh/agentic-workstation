# Architecture

## Overview
[High-level description: what the system does, main components, how data flows]

## Module Boundaries
[Diagram or description of layers / modules and their responsibilities]

## Dependency Rules
[Which modules can import from which — explicit directions]
- Forbidden: [e.g., "handlers must not import directly from database layer"]

## Data Flow
[How a request moves through the system, from entry to response]

## External Dependencies
[Third-party services, APIs, databases — and how they're accessed]
