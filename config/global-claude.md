# Global Preferences

## Working Style
- Always run verify.sh (or verify_fast.sh) after significant changes
- Never auto-commit — let me review diffs first
- Small, atomic changes over large rewrites
- When stuck, explain what's blocking rather than guessing

## Code Quality
- Use structured logging, not console.log
- Write tests for new functionality
- Never weaken or delete tests to make them pass
- Never remove code you don't understand as a side effect

## Communication
- Be concise — skip preamble
- When you hit an edge case with multiple valid approaches, stop and surface options
- If uncertain, say so
